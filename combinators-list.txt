Identity Combinator (I):
I=λx.x

The identity combinator simply returns its argument unchanged.

Fixed-point Combinator (Y or Θ):
The fixed-point combinator allows for the creation of recursive functions in lambda calculus. The Y combinator is defined as:
Y=λf.(λx.f(xx))(λx.f(xx))
It allows for recursion by applying a function to itself.

Mockingbird Combinator (M):
M=λf.ff
The mockingbird combinator applies a function to itself.

K Combinator:
K=λxy.x
The K combinator (also known as the Kestrel) takes two arguments and returns the first one, ignoring the second.

S Combinator:
S=λxyz.(xz)(yz)
The S combinator (also known as the Starling) is used to apply two functions to the same argument.

B Combinator:
B=λxyz.x(yz)
The B combinator (also known as the Bluebird) applies the first function to the result of applying the second function to the third argument.

C Combinator:
C=λxyz.xzy
The C combinator (also known as the Cardinal) is used for flipping the order of the last two arguments.
